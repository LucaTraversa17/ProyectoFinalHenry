With soothing earth tones, lush greenery, a bustling bar and a breezy vibe courtesy of a fully opened facade, it looks and feels like an urban oasis. Expect modern Californian dishes with Spanish leanings from a talented team put together by visionary chef, José Andrés. A tartare turns tradition on its head when ""beefsteak"" is actually tomatoes in a perfect disc, topped with a ""yolk"" made of gelatinous tomato water. A rack of lamb, cut into four, is plated around a circle of red mole sauce and a half baby eggplant, roasted and topped with pea tendrils and puffed rice. Desserts really shine, as in an ethereal pistachio cake with fragrant lime zest and sweet strawberries matched by a tart mascarpone sorbet.",$,4,Los Angeles,USA,California
Ardor,"9040 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, 90069, USA",Californian,-118.3890649,34.0904261,Selected Restaurants,0,"Air conditioning,Car park,Interesting wine list,Restaurant offering vegetarian menus,Valet parking,Wheelchair access","If a luxury spa ran a restaurant, it would probably look something like Ardor. Cushy white velvet and leather booths, white and beige staff uniforms, and enough verdant greenery to rival a small forest match the equally chic aesthetic at its parent venue, the West Hollywood EDITION hotel. The prices are high too, not that any hotel guests would even notice. But know that there is plenty of substance and care packed onto this vegetable-forward menu. Tandoor carrots with hummus and paprika vinaigrette or grilled dukkah-crusted ahi tuna with yogurt make for satisfying, clean eating. Dry-aged lamb and steaks cater to heavier appetites, and no meal is complete without a tower of tempura onion rings and at least one dessert (try the mojito pie).",$,3,West Hollywood,USA,California
Gusto Handcrafted Pasta & Pizza,"1901 Fremont Blvd., Seaside, 93955, USA",Italian-American,-121.8418416,36.6167466,Selected Restaurants,0,"Car park,Wheelchair access","The surroundings may not be glamorous (Monterey airport is just a skip away), but this family-run establishment is a popular venue for large groups—and the proof is in the pasta. Gauging from the sizable menu of saucy, generously portioned Italian-American staples, no one is likely to leave their table hungry. Delightfully al dente house-made pastas are sure to banish any associations with mushy chain restaurant versions, and even hearty, rustic dishes like eggplant parmigiana get an extra touch of care. The from-scratch approach extends to the mozzarella, which is certainly worth sampling, whether as an antipasto or a topping for an array of thin-crust pizzas.Desserts, like cannoli with sweet mascarpone and ricotta, will tick the nostalgia box.",$,2,Seaside,USA,California
Sorella,"1760 Polk St., San Francisco, 94109, USA",Italian,-122.4210529,37.7931112,Selected Restaurants,0,"Air conditioning,Wheelchair access","The spirited younger sister to grande dame Acquerello, this hot spot trades in an air of stately luxury for a more hip, lively vibe. The family resemblance is nonetheless apparent in the thoughtful cuisine, which runs Californian by way of Northern Italy. You can snack on a collection of cicchetti at the well-equipped bar while sipping excellent cocktails, but you'll need to nab a table for a more substantial repast.When in season, a gem lettuce salad with sweet Dungeness crab, fine herbs and anchovy dressing might just be the best possible spin on a classic Caesar, but top-notch ingredients are assured at any time of year. House-made pastas naturally meet the grade, as in a multi-layered baked timballo with dry-aged beef and Comté cheese.",$,3,San Francisco,USA,California

The space is chic and well designed; and the kaiseki-style menu, complete with Japanese-imported fish and local ingredients, is a tribute to the seasons.These plates are meticulously prepared and enjoyably nuanced. The Bizen option may commence with the likes of tofu topped with Bafun uni and yuba, followed by a procession of cold summer bites, sashimi, and silky ankimo with nukazuke pickles. Peak-season belt fish may then be presented with yamaimo and a dashi-simmered tomato. Nigiri, like wild flounder, hagashi toro, and baby sea bream, are crafted with care; and desserts, like rum raisin ice cream, are a wonderful way to seal the second chapter.",$,4,Newport Beach,USA,California

One bite of its luscious burrata, surrounded by Early Girl tomatoes and crispy squash blossoms in the summer, or vinaigrette-dressed pea shoots in spring, proves it hasn’t aged a day. The small, modern space is still charming, with large windows and lots of mirrors. Stunning local artwork for sale decorates the walls.The food spans cultural influences, including a delicate risotto with pine nuts in a cauliflower broth, or soy-sesame glazed halibut atop whipped potatoes and braised kale. A postage stamp-sized bar pours glasses of Sonoma chardonnay and cabernet, perfect with rich strozzapreti tossed with braised pork ragù, Grana Padano and toasted breadcrumbs.",$,3,Sonoma,USA,California

That sense of regard makes its way into the exquisite food, like tomato tart with an ethereal parmesan mousse. The chef's notable flair is also seen in pan-roasted diver scallops set in a Pacific Coast manila clam broth. For dessert, the flourless cake is one of the best in show—perfectly risen and finished with a Meyer lemon curd.",$,3,Calistoga,USA,California
